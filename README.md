SMARTFARMS CHAIN: EMPOWERING RURAL WOMEN WITH BLOCKCHAIN

SmartFarms Chain is an innovative project aimed at solving the problems of access to finance and digital inclusion for rural women in the Ivory Coast, particularly in the animal micro-farm sector. In a context where traditional blockchain solutions, notably cryptocurrencies, remain unregulated locally, SmartFarms Chain proposes a hybrid approach. The project uses Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to represent the identity, reputation and social rights of participants, while mobilizing extra-blockchain funding such as grants, NGO partnerships, and diaspora investments. By combining traceability, transparency, and community solidarity through a DAO model without financial tokens, SmartFarms Chain aims to economically empower rural women, reinforce their resilience, and create a replicable model in other African regions. This project offers a pragmatic, ethical and technological response to the challenges of inclusive agricultural financing.
